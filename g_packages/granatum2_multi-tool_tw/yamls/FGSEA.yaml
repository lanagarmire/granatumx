  title: Fast GSEA (R)
  subtitle: Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis implemented in R
  description: |
    Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) helps identify the biological
    functions related to a list of genes.

    The [fgsea](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/fgsea.html)
    package (authored by Alexey Sergushichev) implements an algorithm for fast
    gene set enrichment analysis. Using the fast algorithm allows to make more
    permutations and get more fine grained p-values, which allows to use
    accurate stantard approaches to multiple hypothesis correction.

            Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment is a technique for interpreting
            sets of genes making use of the Gene Ontology system of
            classification, in which genes are assigned to a set of predefined
            bins depending on their functional characteristics. (From wikipedia)
