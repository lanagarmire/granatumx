  subtitle: Constructing differentiation trajectory with Monocle
  description: >
    This step orders cells in pseudo-time by learning from single-cell assay
    data using Reversed Graph Embedding. The position of each cell in the
    resulting plot is expected to reflect its relative biological state along
    one or more potential cell trajectories.
