    "Accepts assay matrix and geneIds, as well as expression intensity and

    disperson filtering criteria. Returns a plot of gene values and what genes
    are selected

    after filtering, as well as the matrix and geneIds after filtering. The gene
    filtering

    method usese the monocle package as described in Zhu, et al. 2017."
