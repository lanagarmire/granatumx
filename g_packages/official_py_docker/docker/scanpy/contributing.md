### Guidelines

* Respect the coding style defined [here (can be loaded into Emacs, PyCharm, etc.)](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blob/master/.editorconfig) and *try* to stick to 80-character lines.
* Use the numpydoc style for writing docstrings. Either take a look at any Scanpy or Numpy function or [here](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html).
* Write tests for your functions! See [here](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/tree/master/scanpy/tests) for examples.
