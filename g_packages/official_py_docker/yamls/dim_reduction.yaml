  subtitle: Calculates a lower-dimension embedding of the input assay
  description: |
    This step calculates a lower-dimension embedding of the input assay.
    It mainly serves as a means to visualize the data.

    We provide two common methods to reduce the number of dimensions in the
    data:

      1.  Principal component analysis (PCA), which uses orthogonal
          transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated
          variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables, and

      2.  t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which tries to
          model the pairwise similarity between data point in the lower dimensional
          space.
