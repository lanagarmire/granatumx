  subtitle: Generalized Log Transformation based on housekeeping genes and background genes
  description: >
    Glog transformation takes the form:

        y = log((x + sqrt(x^2 + c))/2)

    In our implementation, `c` is calculated based on a selected housekeeping gene and a selected background gene. These
    two genes are selected as the gene whose expression levels have the least standard deviation across all samples,
    amongst most `n` highly/lowly expressed genes.
