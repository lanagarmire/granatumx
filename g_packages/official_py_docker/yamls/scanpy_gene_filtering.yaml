  description: >
    Remove genes that are expressed too lowly (count-based filtering), and
    extract genes that are highly varied across cells (dispersion-based
    filtering).

    The filtering is backended by
    [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The filtering method is
    described in [Satija et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3192).
