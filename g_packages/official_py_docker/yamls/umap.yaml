    A dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualisation similarly to t-SNE
  description: >
    Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for
    visualisation similarly to t-SNE, but also for general non-linear dimension reduction. The algorithm is founded on
    three assumptions about the data

      * The data is uniformly distributed on a Riemannian manifold;
      * The Riemannian metric is locally constant (or can be approximated as such);
      * The manifold is locally connected.

    From these assumptions it is possible to model the manifold with a fuzzy topological structure. The embedding is
    found by searching for a low dimensional projection of the data that has the closest possible equivalent fuzzy
    topological structure.

    The details for the underlying mathematics can be found in [McInnes, L, Healy, J, and Melville, J](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426).

      description: >-
        This parameter controls how UMAP balances local versus global structure in the data. It does this by
        constraining the size of the local neighborhood UMAP will look at when attempting to learn the manifold
        structure of the data. This means that low values of `n_neighbors` will force UMAP to concentrate on very local
        structure (potentially to the detriment of the big picture), while large values will push UMAP to look at larger
        neighborhoods of each point when estimating the manifold structure of the data, losing fine detail structure for
        the sake of getting the broader of the data.
      default: 15
    - injectInto: min_dist
      type: number
      label: Minimum distance (min_dist, a real number ranges from 0 to 1)
      description: >-
        The `min_dist` parameter controls how tightly UMAP is allowed to pack points together. It, quite literally,
        provides the minimum distance apart that points are allowed to be in the low dimensional representation. This
        means that low values of `min_dist` will result in clumpier embeddings. This can be useful if you are interested
        in clustering, or in finer topological structure. Larger values of `min_dist` will prevent UMAP from packing
        point together and will focus instead on the preservation of the broad topological structure instead.
      default: 0.1

      type: select
      label: Metric (metric)
      description: >-
        This parameter controls how distance is computed in the ambient space of the input data.
