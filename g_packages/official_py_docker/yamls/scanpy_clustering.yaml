  description: >
    Louvain graph-clustering is a heuristic method that is based on modularity
    optimization. It was shown in Louvain et al. 2008 "to outperform all other
    known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover,
    the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the
    so-called modularity."

      description: >-
        The Louvain algorithm has a randomly generated inital state which may
        slightly affect the clustering result. Set this seed to a fixed number
        ensures reproducibility.
