  subtitle: Batch effect correction by matching mutual nearest neighbors
  description: >
    A strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional
    expression space. This approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches;
    instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. MNN batch-effect-correction
    method can also be scaled to large numbers of cells. ([ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4091))
