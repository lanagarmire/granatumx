  title: JAMMIT Analysis
  subtitle: Joint Analysis of Many Matrices by Iteration
  description: >
    JAMMIT jointly analyzes an arbitrary number of input data matrices
    and produces low-dimensional signatures for each matrix composed of a
    small number of variables (i.e., matrix rows) that in aggregate exactly
    represents a dominant signal in the row-space of the matrix stack as a
    sparse linear model. A number of different solutions are generated
    on a user-defined grid of "sparsity" parameters. Specific solutions are
    selected by the user based on false discovery rate (FDR) and signature
    size.
