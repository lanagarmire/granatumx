  subtitle: Find out the over-represented gene sets using Fisher's exact test
  description: |
    This is a simple Fisher's exact test that selects gene sets in which the input gene list is over-represented. A
    threshold is selected so that only genes with greater-than-the-threshold score will be considered.

            Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment is a technique for interpreting
            sets of genes making use of the Gene Ontology system of
            classification, in which genes are assigned to a set of predefined
            bins depending on their functional characteristics. (From wikipedia)
