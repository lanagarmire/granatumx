        If the input number is greater than 0 and less than 1, it is understood
        as a percentage of the original number of cells to sample. If the input
        number is greater than or equal to 1 and is an integer, it is understood
        as the desired number of cells after down-sampling. If it is greater
        than the number of the number of cells, all cells will be kept.
