  description: |
    This step calculates a lower-dimension embedding of the input assay using
    [Principal component analysis
    (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), which
    uses orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly
    correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated
    variables.
