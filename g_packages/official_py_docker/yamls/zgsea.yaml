  description: |
    Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) helps identify the biological
    functions related to a list of genes.

            Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment is a technique for interpreting
            sets of genes making use of the Gene Ontology system of
            classification, in which genes are assigned to a set of predefined
            bins depending on their functional characteristics. (From wikipedia)
