  title: Clustering Quality Measure
  subtitle: 'Measures the quality of a clustering with regard to a given "true" clustering'
  description: |
    The following two measurements are calculated.

      * [Adjusted Rand Score](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score.html)
      * [Adjusted mutual information score](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score.html)

    With both measurements, the larger the value the better, with 1 meaning the
    predicted clustering has perfect agreement with the provided truth, and 0
    meaning the clustering is close to random guessing.
