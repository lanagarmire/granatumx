    Cell normalization is a common pre-processing technique that eliminates the
    unwanted variation between the cells caused by the different library sizes and
    different data distribution.

      description: Use log(x + 1) in the boxplots. Recommended for non-log transformed assays to have visualization clarity.

        Plotting too many cells in the same bar-plot will render the plot
        intelligible.
