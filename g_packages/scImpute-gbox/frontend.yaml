description: >
  Imputation is the process of filling missing data that an experiment failed to
  capture. In comparison to bulk cell RNAseq, the starting amount of mRNA in
  single cell RNAseq is very low which makes it difficult to capture the whole
  gene expression values for each cell. The imputation step can be very useful
  to increase the power of the downstream analysis.\n\nHere, we implemented
  scImpute, an imputation method for single cell RNAseq using weighted LASSO.
  There are several steps to this algorithm. First, for each gene, it estimates
  the cell dropout probability using a gamma-gauss mixture model. Each cell can
  then be sorted into dropout or not (using a threshold parameter). Then, it
  imputes each cell independantly: Using the good quality genes, it builds a
  weighted LASSO model to define predictors, and use these predictors to impute
  the dropout values."
