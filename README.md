## Creating a Gbox

GranatumX ships with a template to make it easier for developers to create new Gboxes. Below is a checklist for creating a new Gbox.

1. Download the GranatumX Source Code `git clone https://gitlab.com/xz/GranatumX`
2. In the GranatumX folder, run `make setup`. After setup completes, GranatumX should start on port `34567`
3. Copy the Gbox template into the `g_packages` directory: `cp gboxTemplate g_packages/yourPackageName`
4. Edit your `package.yaml` file with your package information. See other packages in the `g_packages` folder for more examples.
5. Edit your `Dockerfile` by adding any package installation scripts your Gbox requires.
6. Edit your `main.py` file with your application code (or whatever file you specified in `package.yaml > gboxes > endpoints > backend > cmd`). The Python package `granatum_sdk` contains helper methods for easily interacting with the GranatumX core.
7. Install your new gbox with `cd gboxes; yarn run installEverything`
8. Refresh GranatumX and test your new Gbox.

## Running your own server

### Environment Variables

If starting the server with sudo you may need to add the -E flag to use your current environment variables (sudo -E make start).

* PORT: Port # to listen to, i.e. 80, 3000, 8888
* DATABASE_URL: Url to connect to your Postgresql database server
* SSL_CERT: (optional) To serve Granatum on port 443 over SSL, set to certificate filepath
* SSL_KEY: (optional) To serve Granatum on port 443 over SSL, set to private key filepath
